## Introduction
Welcome To Popular Github Repos


### Purpose
This app was built after having spent 4 months doing a deep dive into the Angular Framework. The goal was to refamiliarize with the React ecosystem. With an emphasis on fundamental concepts such as class based components, component composition, props, state, SetState, and React Router. Their are more but that's what came to mind initially. 

### AfterMath
Having Completed Github Repos I feel re acclimated. Honestly having spent so much time in Angular I understand the benefits of state management and compoents better. From Here I'm going to do the same thing with React Hooks. Although I'm using React Router I know I'm only scratching the surface. Moving forward I'll keep building side projects as I prepare to launch the Pulse Media Site. Pulse Media is a Software Company I'm building in my local area to help promote small businesses.
